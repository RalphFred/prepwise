The land heats up and cools down more quickly than the sea.*   **Land Breeze:** At night, the land cools faster, causing the air above it to cool and become denser. This denser air sinks, creating a high-pressure zone over the land. Meanwhile, the sea, which is warmer, causes the air above it to rise. This creates a low-pressure zone over the sea, and the air flows from the land (high pressure) to the sea (low pressure).*   **Sea Breeze:** During the day, the land heats up faster, causing the air above it to heat and rise. This creates a low-pressure zone over the land. The air over the cooler sea is denser, creating a high-pressure zone. The air then flows from the sea (high pressure) to the land (low pressure).Conduction and radiation also play a role in heat transfer, but they are not the primary drivers of the land and sea breeze."

      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "1. When a negatively charged rod is brought close to the metal sphere, it induces a separation of charges within the sphere. Electrons in the sphere are repelled by the negatively charged rod and move to the side of the sphere farthest from the rod, leaving the near side with a net positive charge.2. If the sphere is then earthed (connected to the Earth), electrons will flow from the ground to the sphere, neutralizing the positive charge induced by the rod. After earthing, the sphere will have an excess of electrons and, thus, a net negative charge.3. When the negatively charged rod is taken away, the sphere retains the excess electrons it gained during earthing, resulting in a net negative charge.Therefore, the correct option is: The sphere will have a net negative charge."

      "explanation": "\"The stopping potential increases.\"In the photoelectric effect, when light of a certain frequency (equal to or greater than the threshold frequency) is incident on a metal surface, photoelectrons are emitted. The stopping potential is the minimum potential that must be applied to stop these emitted photoelectrons.If the frequency of the incident light is increased beyond the threshold frequency:- The kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases.- To stop photoelectrons with higher kinetic energy, a higher stopping potential is required.Therefore, as the frequency of the incident light increases, the stopping potential also increases to counteract the increased kinetic energy of the photoelectrons."

      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Solution in Own Words:To find the radius of an air bubble as it rises from a depth of 12 m below the water surface to the surface, we can use Boyle's law, which states that the product of pressure and volume is constant for a given mass of gas at constant temperature.Initially, the pressure (\\(P_1\\)) on the bubble at a depth of 12 m is the sum of atmospheric pressure and the pressure due to the water column above it, which is 22.34 m of water. The initial volume (\\(V_1\\)) is calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere.As the bubble rises to the surface, the pressure (\\(P_2\\)) decreases to the atmospheric pressure of 10.34 m of water. The final volume (\\(V_2\\)) is again calculated using the volume formula.Applying Boyle's law (\\(P_1V_1 = P_2V_2\\)), we can set up an equation and solve for the final radius (\\(r_2\\)).\\(r_1\\) = 4.5cm, \\( P_1\\) = total pressure on the bubble at a depth of 12m from the surface.\\(P_1\\) = 12\u00a0+ 10.34\u00a0=22.34m\\(V_1\\)\u00a0= \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\u03c0\u00d7 \\(r^3_1\\)= \\(\\frac{4}{3}\u00d7 \u03c0\u00d7{4.5^3cm^3}\\)\\(P_2\\)\u00a0= 10.34m\\(V_2\\)\u00a0\u00a0= \\(\\frac{4}{3} {\u03c0}{r^3_2}\\)From Boyles Law,\\(P_1V_1\\)\u00a0\u00a0=\u00a0\\(P_2V_2\\)22.34\u00d7 \\(\\frac{4}{3}\u00d7 \u03c0\u00d7{4.5^3}\\) = 10.34 \u00d7 \\(\\frac{4}{3}\u00d7\u03c0\u00d7{r^3_2}\\)22.34 \u00d7 \\(4.5^3\\) = 10.34 \u00d7 \\(r^3_2\\)\\(r^3_2\\)= \\(\\^3\u221a196.88\\)\\(r^3_2\\) = 5.82cm"

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Nuclear fusion is the process responsible for the production of energy in stars, including our Sun. This process involves the fusion (combination) of light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process. In the core of stars like the Sun, hydrogen nuclei (protons) undergo nuclear fusion to form helium nuclei.The basic fusion reaction occurring in stars, particularly in the Sun, is the proton-proton chain reaction. In this process, hydrogen nuclei fuse together to form helium, and the excess mass is converted into energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle (E=mc\u00b2).Nuclear reactions involve the release or absorption of energy through changes in atomic nuclei, and in the context of stars, nuclear fusion is the primary mechanism through which stars generate the energy that sustains their luminosity and heat. Therefore, Option C, \"Nuclear fusion,\" is the correct choice for the process responsible for the production of energy in stars."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The beam balance works on the principle of moments. Moments are torques or turning forces that cause an object to rotate around a pivot or a fixed point. In a beam balance, the object to be weighed is placed on one side of a balanced beam, and standard weights are placed on the other side. When the beam is level, the moments on both sides are equal, indicating that the weights are in equilibrium. This principle is essential for accurate measurement of mass using a beam balance."

When light is refracted, the different wavelengths are bent at slightly different angles, separating the colors. This separation of white light into its component colors is called dispersion. The combined effect of refraction, reflection, and dispersion produces the rainbow.Therefore, dispersion is the primary phenomenon responsible for separating sunlight into its component colors, which is what forms the rainbow."

We are given the horizontal component (effective force).\n2.  **Use trigonometry:** The angle given is 30 degrees *to the vertical*, so the angle to the horizontal is 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. The horizontal component of the tension (Fx) can be written as:  Fx = T * cos(\u03b8), where T is the tension and \u03b8 is the angle between the rope and the horizontal.\n3.  **Solve for Tension (T):** We know Fx = 15 N and \u03b8 = 60 degrees.

If water wets the glass of the thermometer, it will cling to the sides of the glass tube, making it difficult to read the temperature accurately. This is because the meniscus of the water will change, affecting the level reading.*   **II. It needs to be coloured:** While coloring water might be done for better visibility, it's not a fundamental reason why water is unsuitable. Other thermometric liquids can also be colored.*   **III. It has a low density:** While this is true to a degree (compared to some other liquids), it is not a primary reason for its unsuitability. The main issue is its ability to wet glass.Therefore, the most significant reason water is unsuitable is its wetting of glass."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Air friction, also known as air resistance or drag, opposes the motion of an object through the air.*   **Streaming:** Streamlining involves shaping an object to reduce its surface area exposed to the airflow and create a more aerodynamic shape. This minimizes the contact area between the object and the air molecules, thereby reducing friction.*   **Lubricating:** Lubrication is primarily used to reduce friction between solid surfaces in contact with each other. It's not directly applicable to reducing air friction.*   **Propeller:** A propeller is used to generate thrust, propelling an object forward through the air. It does not directly reduce air friction; rather, it helps overcome it.*   **Polishing:** Polishing can reduce surface roughness, which can minimize friction between *solid* surfaces. However, it doesn't directly address the air friction."

Ebonite rods become negatively charged, while glass rods become positively charged.\n*   Opposite charges attract each other. Therefore, a negatively charged ebonite rod will be attracted to a positively charged glass rod.\n*   Repulsion only occurs between objects with the same type of charge.\n*   A spark may occur if the charges are strong enough and the distance is small enough, but it is not the primary interaction.\n*   There will always be a force (attraction or repulsion) between charged objects."

The diagram (which is not provided but is referenced in the question) would show a force applied at an angle of 60\u00ba.  Assuming the applied force is 50N, then the horizontal component (the effective force) can be calculated using the cosine function:1.  **Identify the relevant formula:**  Horizontal component = Force * cos(angle)2.  **Plug in the values:** Horizontal component = 50 N * cos(60\u00ba)3.  **Calculate:** cos(60\u00ba) = 0.5, therefore Horizontal component = 50 N * 0.5 = 25 N. However, this answer is not among the available options.4.  **Apply the other formula that could be in the context of the question** Vertical component = Force * sin(angle). Horizontal component = 50 * sin(60) = 50 * 0.866 = 43.30N"
