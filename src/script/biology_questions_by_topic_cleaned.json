      "explanation": "Adaptation is process by which an animal or plant species becomes fitted to its environment; it is the result of natural selection\u2019s acting upon heritable variation. Even the simpler organisms must be adapted in a great variety of ways: in their structure, physiology, and genetics, in their locomotion or dispersal, in their means of defense and attack, in their reproduction and development, and in other respects.Evolution explains how living things change over a long time, and how they have come to be the way they areVariation is any difference between cells, individual organisms, or groups of organisms of any species caused either by genetic differences (genotypic variation) or by the effect of environmental factors on the expression of the genetic potentials (phenotypic variation). Variation may be shown in physical appearance, metabolism, fertility, mode of reproduction, behaviour, learning and mental ability.Succession is the process by which the structure of a biological community evolves over time. Two different types of succession\u2014primary and secondary\u2014have been distinguished. Primary succession occurs in essentially lifeless areas\u2014regions in which the soil is incapable of sustaining life as a result of such factors as lava flows, newly formed sand dunes, or rocks left from a retreating glacier.Secondary succession occurs in areas where a community that previously existed has been removed; it is typified by smaller-scale disturbances that do not eliminate all life and nutrients from the environment."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Savannas are quite low in tree species diversity because of stringent ecological requirements but fairly high in diversity of herbaceous plants. Tree growth is controlled not only by rainfall but also by soil type; large areas of hardpan soils, allow no tree roots to penetrate except through cracks, and the cracks determine tree distribution.Large mammals are at their most diverse in this open environment, in which they can move about freely and yet find shelter among woody vegetation. Large herbivores are successful because of the tremendous biomass of herbaceous vegetation produced annually, and there are many carnivores to crop them in turn.Tropical rain forests occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season, distinct buttress roots of trees.Montane forest refers to any ecosystem found in mountains. These ecosystems are strongly affected by climate, which gets colder as elevation increases.A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The mouth-brooding behavior in Tilapia is primarily a protective strategy. Here's why:\n\n*   **Protection from Predation:** The adult Tilapia carries the eggs or young fry in its mouth, shielding them from potential predators. This significantly increases the survival rate of the offspring.\n*   **Other options:**\n    *   Keeping the young fish warm: While the mouth might provide some temperature regulation, it's not the primary function.\n    *   Living in a social group: Mouth-brooding is more about individual parental care, not necessarily fostering social behavior in the young.\n    *   Providing regurgitated nourishment: While some fish may provide parental feeding, this is not the primary function of mouth-brooding in Tilapia."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The theory of natural selection, a core concept in evolutionary biology, is best explained by option C. Here's why:*   **Natural selection** is the process where organisms with traits better suited to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully.*   **Option C, \"The weaker offspring are eliminated,\"** directly reflects this principle. Individuals with less advantageous traits are less likely to survive and pass on their genes, leading to a shift in the characteristics of a population over time.Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:*   **A. There is no struggle for existence:** This is the opposite of what the theory suggests. Natural selection is driven by competition for resources, survival, and reproduction, creating a \"struggle for existence.\"*   **B. New species get better adaptation:** While adaptation is a result of natural selection, this statement does not fully explain the theory's core mechanism, which is the selective elimination of less fit individuals.*   **D. Unused structures disappear later:** This describes the theory of \"use and disuse,\" which is associated with Lamarckian evolution and not natural selection."
