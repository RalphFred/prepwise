Given that the ratio of molar masses is 12:1, and the empirical formula has one X and one Y, we can deduce the molecular formula.    *   Let the molecular formula be (XY)n    *   The molar mass of the molecular formula is: n \\* (72 + 6) = 78n    *   We can not use empirical formula alone to get molecular formula. But knowing vapor density helps us to calculate.3.  **Calculate molar mass using vapor density:**    *   Vapor density is half the molar mass. Therefore, Molar Mass = 2 \\* Vapor Density    *   We can't directly solve for the exact molar mass of the molecular formula using only the empirical formula and molar masses of the individual elements. We need a piece of information about the total molar mass of the compound or its relationship to vapor density.    *   A relationship between the molar mass (M) and the vapor density (VD) exists:        *   M = 2 \\* VD4.  **Finding the correct answer:**    *   The question provides answer choices which represent the vapor density.    *   We can use options to guess.    *   If the vapor density is 33 (Option A), then Molar mass = 2 \\* 33 = 66.    *   If the vapor density is 66 (Option B), then Molar mass = 2 \\* 66 = 132.    *   If the vapor density is 39 (Option C), then Molar mass = 2"

      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "If a reversible reaction is subjected to a decrease in temperature, the position of equilibrium will shift in the direction that absorbs heat. This shift is dictated by Le Chatelier's principle.In general terms:- If temperature decreases, the reaction will shift in the endothermic direction (the direction that absorbs heat).- If temperature increases, the reaction will shift in the exothermic direction (the direction that releases heat).So, for the given scenario of a decrease in temperature: The position of equilibrium shifts to the left.This is because shifting to the left corresponds to the endothermic direction, helping to absorb the reduced external heat."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "An alkene with six carbon atoms has the chemical formula C\u2086H\u2081\u2082. The general formula for an alkene is CnH2n, where \"n\" is the number of carbon atoms.In this case, n = 6, so the formula is C\u2086H\u2081\u2082. Each carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in an alkene contains one pi (\\(\\pi\\)) bond. Since there are two carbon atoms involved in each double bond, the number of pi bonds is equal to half the number of carbon-carbon double bonds.For a molecule with 6 carbon atoms, there are 5 carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). Therefore, the number of pi (\\(\\pi\\)) bonds is 5/2, which is 2.5.However, since pi bonds cannot exist in fractional amounts, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, an alkene with six carbon atoms has 2 pi (\\(\\pi\\)) bonds.So, the correct answer is 4."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Here's how to determine the empirical formula:1.  **Assume a 100g sample:** This makes the percentages directly represent the masses of each element. Therefore, we have 60g of Oxygen and 40g of Sulfur (100g - 60g).2.  **Convert masses to moles:**    *   Moles of Oxygen (O): 60 g / 16 g/mol = 3.75 mol    *   Moles of Sulfur (S): 40 g / 32 g/mol = 1.25 mol3.  **Determine the mole ratio:** Divide both mole values by the smallest number of moles (1.25 mol):    *   O: 3.75 mol / 1.25 mol = 3    *   S: 1.25 mol / 1.25 mol = 14.  **Write the empirical formula:** The ratio gives us one sulfur atom for every three oxygen atoms, therefore, the empirical formula is SO\\\\(_3\\\\).    **Note:** There seems to be a discrepancy in the options provided. The correct answer based on the calculation is SO\\\\(_3\\\\), but that isn't one of the options. SO\\\\(_2\\\\) is the closest, and is the more common oxide of sulfur, so it is likely the intended answer based on the available options. The calculation here shows the steps for finding the empirical formula if an oxide has a 60% oxygen composition, which would have been SO\\\\(_3\\\\)."

This is achieved using an electrolytic cell.*   **Cathode:** The cathode is where reduction occurs, and where the metal ions from the electrolyte will be deposited. In this case, we want to plate the spoon, so the spoon is the cathode.*   **Anode:** The anode is where oxidation occurs. To plate with silver, the anode needs to be a silver source. A silver rod serves this purpose as it provides the silver ions to be deposited on the spoon.*   **Electrolyte:** The electrolyte contains the metal ions that will be deposited. In this case, a soluble silver salt (e.g., silver nitrate, AgNO3) is used to provide the silver ions (Ag+)."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When n = 3, this refers to the principal quantum number, which describes the energy level.*   The number of orbitals in an energy level (n) is given by n^2. Therefore, in the third energy level (n=3), there are 3^2 = 9 orbitals.*   Each orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.*   Thus, the total number of electrons in the third energy level is 9 orbitals * 2 electrons/orbital = 18 electrons."

The use of litmus paper:** Both strong and weak acids turn blue litmus paper red. Litmus paper only indicates the presence of an acid, not the strength of the acid.*   **C. Measurement of pH:** Strong acids have a lower pH (closer to 0) than weak acids at the same concentration.*   **D. Measurement of heat of reaction:** Strong acids release more heat during a reaction (e.g., with a base) because the reaction goes to completion more readily."

Since there are six cyanide ligands, the prefix \"hexa\" is used.3.  **Name the central metal:** The central metal is iron (Fe).4.  **Determine the oxidation state of the metal:**    *   Potassium (K) has a +1 charge. Since there are four potassium ions, the total positive charge is +4.    *   Each cyanide ligand (CN) has a -1 charge, and there are six of them, so the total negative charge from the ligands is -6.    *   Let *x* be the oxidation state of iron. The overall charge of the complex ion is -4.    *   Therefore, +4 + *x* - 6 = 0    *   *x* - 2 = 0    *   *x* = +2, therefore iron has an oxidation state of +25.  **Combine the names:** The IUPAC name is potassium hexacyanoferrate(II).

        "C": "High thermal conductivity,",
        "D": "Readily form cations in chemical reactions"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A more detailed explanation of why non-metals tend to gain electrons in chemical reactions:1.Electron Affinity: Non-metals generally have a higher electron affinity, which means they have a greater tendency to gain electrons. Electron affinity is the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion (anion).2.Electronegativity: Non-metals typically have higher electronegativity values compared to metals. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons in a chemical bond. Non-metals, being more electronegative, have a tendency to attract electrons toward themselves.3.Formation of Anions: In chemical reactions, non-metals often form negative ions (anions) by gaining electrons. This behaviour allows them to achieve a stable electron configuration similar to that of noble gases. By gaining electrons, non-metals can fill or complete their outer electron shells.4.Ionic Bonds in Compounds: Non-metals and metals often form ionic compounds through the transfer of electrons. In these compounds, non-metals acquire electrons from metals, leading to the formation of negatively charged ions (anions). The attraction between positively charged metal ions (cations) and negatively charged non-metal ions results in the ionic bond.In summary, the tendency of non-metals to gain electrons is deeply rooted in their electron affinity and electronegativity, ultimately leading to the formation of negatively charged ions in various chemical reactions."

      "explanation": "Rust is a common name for a very common compound, iron oxide. Specifically, rust refers to the reddish-brown substance that forms on the surface of iron or steel when it reacts with oxygen and moisture in the presence of air. The chemical process through which this corrosion occurs is known as oxidation.The primary chemical formula for rust is **Fe\u2082O\u2083**, but the exact composition can vary. Rust is often a mixture of iron oxides and hydroxides, and it's commonly represented as a hydrated iron(III) oxide, denoted as \\(Fe_2O_3 \\cdot nH_2O\\), indicating the presence of water molecules.The formation of rust can be represented by the following simplified chemical equation:\\[ 4Fe + 3O_2 + 6H_2O \\rightarrow 4Fe(OH)_3 \\]This process is accelerated by the presence of electrolytes (such as salts) and is commonly observed on objects made of iron or steel exposed to the atmosphere, especially in humid conditions.

Generally, non-metals loose electrons to achieve the octet.

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A spontaneous reaction is a reaction that will occur naturally without any external influence. The spontaneity of a reaction is determined by the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G), which combines enthalpy change (\u0394H) and entropy change (\u0394S) in the following equation:\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394SA reaction is spontaneous if the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) is negative. While enthalpy change and entropy change contribute to the value of \u0394G, the most direct indicator of spontaneity is a negative free energy change. However, in this case, only enthalpy change is offered as a choice. Since the question is about a typical chemical reaction, the most appropriate answer is:*   **A.** Enthalpy change is negative.    *   This refers to an exothermic reaction, which *can* be spontaneous. However, it is not the sole factor in determining spontaneity."

This means Rate(X) = 2 * Rate(Y).3.  **Applying Graham's Law:**    *   Rate(X) / Rate(Y) = \u221a(M(Y) / M(X))    *   Since Rate(X) = 2 * Rate(Y), then 2 = \u221a(M(Y) / M(X))4.  **Solving for the molar mass ratio:**    *   Square both sides: 4 = M(Y) / M(X)    *   Therefore, M(Y) = 4 * M(X).5.  **Conclusion:** Gas Y is four times as heavy as Gas X."

This means that when HCl is dissolved in water, it fully dissociates into its ions, H+ (hydrogen ions) and Cl- (chloride ions). This complete ionization results in a high concentration of H+ ions, which is the characteristic feature of a strong acid. The other options are not the primary reason why HCl is considered a strong acid."

      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When a substance is oxidized, it loses electrons. Oxidation is a process in which a substance loses electrons, and the term \"LEO\" (Loses Electrons Oxidation) is often used to remember this concept.\"Loses electrons,\" is the correct description of the oxidation process. In contrast, gaining oxygen atoms or gaining electrons is associated with reduction, not oxidation. Losing protons (H+ ions) is not a typical aspect of oxidation."
